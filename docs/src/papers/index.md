# Papers

The module `RealTimeScheduling.Papers` provides implementations of proposed
algorithms (schedulers, schedulabity tests, etc.) from published papers.  These
are typically of less broad applicability than the things implemented directly
in the `RealTimeScheduling` package, but still of interest to the broader
real-time community.

If you use RealTimeScheduling.jl in your research, please consider contributing
your code to this module!
