# Weakly Hard Systems

RealTimeScheduling provides basic support for weakly hard constraints.

!!! warning
    Support for weakly hard systems is still a work in progress, and the API is
    still very incomplete.  For now, we only support the constraints
    themselves, as well as comparisons between them.
