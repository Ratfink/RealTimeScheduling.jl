# RealTimeScheduling

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Ratfink/RealTimeScheduling.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Ratfink/RealTimeScheduling.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

Real-time systems modeling and schedulability analysis

This package aims to provide useful tools for writing schedulability studies
with Julia.  The functionality is currently quite minimal, as the package is in
early stages of development, but more features will be added in the future.
It is inspired by [SchedCAT](https://github.com/brandenburg/schedcat) by BjÃ¶rn
Brandenburg, but is not a direct port since Julia isn't Python. ðŸ˜‰
