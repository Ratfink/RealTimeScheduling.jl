Real-time systems modeling and schedulability analysis

![Logo](docs/src/assets/logo.svg)

This package aims to provide useful tools for writing schedulability studies
with Julia.  It provides basic functionality for schedulability testing,
response time analysis, schedule simulation, and schedule plotting.
It is inspired by [SchedCAT](https://github.com/brandenburg/schedcat) by BjÃ¶rn
Brandenburg, but is not a direct port since Julia isn't Python. ðŸ˜‰
